Basically I group papers by each author, each time period.

Period:-

[defined in PeriodBoundary#yearBoundary = {2000.5, 2003.5, 2006.5, 2009.5};
Time periods 1,2,3 are as defined by Vanesh (email 6/8/12): 2001-2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009

Time period 0 year<= 2000
Time period 1 year = 2001, 2002, or 2003
Time period 2 year = 2004, 2005, or 2006
Time period 3 year = 2007, 2008, or 2009
Time period 4 year>= 2010

Extra data from Tim:-


For each author and each time period I limit to data further using the following criteria, either separately or together:-

a) All vs Solo paper vs Team paper.  A team paper is any where there are two or more authors.  Number of solo and team papers should equal the All
category.

b) Any order vs Alpha vs NAlpha. Papers either have their authors in alphabetic (Alpha) order or not (NAlpha).  Clearly this may or may not be the reason
behind.  Note that when neither Alpha nor NAlpha is indicated I have kept papers regardless of the order of their authors.

There are therefore 7 possible categories of paper (for solo author papers the author order is irrelevant. I have
only given 5 with NAlphaAll and AlphaAll missing.

Tim data starts from column U.

First 12 Tim columns:-

These are basic statistics for all papers and for team papers.  The mean is the mean number of authors on the set of papers (given author, given period,
all or team).  The next 5 numbers are the quartiles, so Q2 is the median.  It gives a crude sense of the distribution.

Note that the only equivalent data for Solo papers is the total number of such papers, and it is given in column AS.  The column AT gives this as a
percentage of the author's total publications for that period.

Most remaining columns (except for the two solo columns)

These are grouped by different subsets of papers:- the three combinations of team paper (Any order, Alpha or NAlpha) and all papers (any order).
In each case I give 6 columns for the absolute numbers followed by 6 for the percentages (the first 6 columns divided by the total number of papers for
the author that period).  The six columns are as follows:
1) 1st - number of papers where author is first
2) Last - number of papers where author is last and not 1st (so no.authors >=2)
3) 2nd - number of papers where author is 2nd and not first or last (so no.authors >=3)
4)  PenU - number of papers where author is penultimate and not 1st,2nd or last (so no.authors >=4)
5) Other - number of papers where author is not 1st, 2nd, penultimate or last (so no.authors >=5)
6) Total - all papers for that author in that period, should be sum of previous 5 numbers
